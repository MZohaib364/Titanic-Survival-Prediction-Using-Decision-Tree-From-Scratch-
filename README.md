# Titanic Survival Prediction Using Decision Tree (From Scratch)

This project implements a **Decision Tree Classifier** from scratch to predict passenger survival on the **Titanic dataset**. The goal is to understand how decision trees work internally by building the model without using machine learning libraries like scikit-learn.

## ðŸš¢ Project Overview

- **Dataset:** Titanic Passenger Data (Kaggle or similar)  
- **Algorithm:** Custom-built Decision Tree Classifier  
- **Objective:** Predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster

## ðŸ”¥ Key Features

- Custom implementation of **entropy** for optimal splitting  
- Manual handling of **data preprocessing** (missing values, encoding, etc.)  
- Visualization of decision-making processes within the tree  
- Performance evaluation using **accuracy**
